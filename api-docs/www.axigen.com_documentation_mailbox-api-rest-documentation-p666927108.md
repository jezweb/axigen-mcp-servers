The Mailbox API is available starting with Axigen X4 (10.4).

## Axigen's Mailbox REST API

The API provides access to a mailbox to any REST client that is able to authenticate against one of the Axigen accounts.

The API input and output are restricted to UTF-8 and, while Axigen will attempt to validate and reject any invalid UTF-8 input, it will never attempt to convert from arbitrary encodings (e.g. ISO-8859-1) to UTF-8.

A message can be sent where one or more MIME parts or attachments are not encoded in UTF-8 but where the API is concerned these are just pass through events – no processing is done for this type of payload.

## Terms Used in this Document

### User

The user is the person that owns the account that is being accessed by the API.

In Axigen a user can only own one mailbox. The user and mailbox identified is formed by appending the account name together with the domain name. E.g. `user@domain.com`.

### Account

An account is a user's principal id.

Accounts used over the API are always fully qualified (they always contain the domain name, even when the domain in question is set as a primary domain).

### Domain

This is the account's domain.

Accounts always belong to a domain defined in Axigen.

### Mailbox

A mailbox contains a collection of folders that in turn contain a collection of messages (emails).

In email terminology (e.g. in the IMAP RFC) sometimes a mailbox is used interchangeably with folder.

In this API however, mailbox is a single entity that is comprised of all the user's folders.

### Folder

A folder contains a collection of items.

There are multiple folder types (e.g. normal folders for emails, calendar folders for calendar items, etc). For the purposes of this API, a folder cannot contain a mixture of items (e.g. emails and calendar items).

**Special Folders**

A number of folders are designated as special folders (this is due to various restrictions deriving from various protocols but mainly IMAP).

Among these are Inbox, Sent, Trash, etc.

These folders are immovable. They cannot be deleted, moved, or renamed.

**Special Folders Localization**

In order to support localization for special folders, the folder related endpoints use a `role` property defining the exact role of the folder (e.g. `inbox`, `drafts`, `sent`, etc.)

**Folder Ownership**

In Axigen, there are three folder ownership types:

1. **local folders** – folders owned by the current user

2. **shared folders** – folders owned by some other user who has granted some form of access to the current user

3. **public folders** – folders owned by the public folder user who has granted some form of access to the current user


When using API calls, the type of folder they operate on may subtly change the outcome of an API call (e.g. you cannot delete to Trash a message from a non-local folder).
