# Server Files Need Restoration

The complete server implementations were created but lost during repository cleanup.

## What Was Implemented

Each server contained:
- Full authentication utilities (utils.py)
- Comprehensive tool implementations
- Error handling and validation
- Session caching for performance

### Settings Server
- 13 tools for account preferences, signatures, vacation replies
- UI settings storage
- Contact information management

### Filters Server
- 10 tools for whitelist/blacklist management
- Bulk operations
- Spam settings configuration

### Security Server
- 9 tools for temporary aliases, passwords, security policies
- Quota monitoring
- Account limits tracking

## To Restore

The full implementations can be recreated from the design specifications in SCRATCHPAD.md or by re-running the implementation process.
